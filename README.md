# Rick and Morty Characters
Jetpack Compose was released recently, might as well explore it. I made this simple Rick and Morty character displaying app using this open [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-characters) .

### Technical Feature
* Fetching Rick and Morty characters from API
* Displaying of few details using another view
* Navigation
* MVVM as architecture
* Ofc we used Jetpack Compose to create the layout.

### Under development
....blah blah


### Notes
*Would like to commend this course: [Android Jetpack Compose Crash course on creating clean UIs](https://www.udemy.com/course/jetpack-compose-masterclass/)
